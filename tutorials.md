Below are a series of tutorials, designed to slowly introduce the user to various concepts
and features within Wallace. After completing these tutorials, the user should have a solid
grasp of how to use Wallace for a wide range of problems, and should be familiar with a
number of different algorithms, representations and operators.

These tutorials also make a great companion to any evolutionary computation course, and
have successfully been used to teach in the classroom. If you're interested in using
Wallace to teach part of your curriculum, then let us know by emailing:

1. <a href="max_ones/"><b>Tutorial 1: Max Ones.</b></a>
    Demonstrates how to interact with Wallace via the REPL, and how to compose a basic
    genetic algorithm to solve the max ones problem using Wallace's domain-specific language.
2. <a href="numerical_optimisation/"><b>Tutorial 2: Numerical Optimisation.</b></a>
    Introduces the floating point vector representation, and shows how to solve a range of
    scalar numerical optimisation problems using a genetic algorithm.
3. <a href="tsp/"><b>Tutorial 3: Travelling Salesman Problem.</b></a>
    Demonstrates how the permutation representation can be used with memetic algorithms to
    solve the travelling salesman problem, as well as showing how to extend Wallace
    with a custom evaluator.
4. <a href="symbolic/"><b>Tutorial 4: Symbolic Regression.</b></a>
    Shows how loosely-typed genetic programming can be used to solve symbolic regression
    problems. It also looks at several different tree building algorithms, the use of
    ephemeral random constants, and parsimony pressure techniques for reducing bloat.
