# Tutorial 2: Numerical Function Minimisation using Genetic Algorithms

Building on the previous tutorial, in this tutorial we shall be using simple
Genetic Algorithms once again, this time to minimise a series of
multi-modal benchmark functions. In order to determine the minima of these
functions, we make use of the floating point vector representation, used to
represent fixed-length real-valued vectors.

**This tutorial assumes:**

* You have a minimal knowledge of [Julia](http://www.julialang.org).
* You have completed the first tutorial.
* You know how to construct a simple Genetic Algorithm using Wallace.

**By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:**

* Evolve fixed-length real-valued vectors.
* Write a simple GA to solve multi-modal numerical optimisation problems.
