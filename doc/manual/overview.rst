Overview
========

This chapter provides a high-level overview of Wallace.jl, installation
instructions, information on the different ways to interact with Wallace,
and an example algorithm for solving the Max Ones problem.

Installation
============

The latest stable version of Wallace can be installed via a simple one line
command from within the Julia REPL, given below:

::

  Pkg.add("Wallace")

Alternatively, if you wish to install the bleeding-edge version of Wallace
from the master GitHub branch, you may do so by executing the following
from within the REPL instead:

::

  Pkg.clone("https://github.com/ChrisTimperley/Wallace.jl")

If Wallace is already installed on your system, but you believe it to be out
of date, you may execute the following command via the REPL:

::

  Pkg.update("Wallace")

For information on installing the latest version of Julia, visit the Downloads
page of the Julia website, at: http://julialang.org/downloads/
