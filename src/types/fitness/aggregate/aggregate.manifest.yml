id: fitness/aggregate

description: |
  This fitness scheme operates by aggregating the weighted values of each of
  the objectives into a single scalar value, which is to be either maximised
  or minimised.

properties:

  # Add objectives as a property instead?
  weights:
    type:         list(Float)
    default:      An equal set of weights, which sum to one.
    description:  >
      A list holding the weights used for each of the objective values upon
      aggregation.

  maximise:
    type:         Boolean
    default:      True
    description:  >
      A flag indicating whether the aggregated fitness value should be
      maximised.
