## Max Ones
### An Introduction to Solving Optimisation Problems with Genetic Algorithms
Outline of this tutorial.

**This tutorial assumes:**
* You know how to interact with Julia through the command line and the REPL.
* You know how to load Wallace specification files and run them.
* You know a little bit about the basic structure of Wallace specification files. 

**By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:**
* Write a simple binary-string genetic algorithm.
* Use Wallace to solve simple binary-string optimisation problems, such as the
  Max Ones problem.
