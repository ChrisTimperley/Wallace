Wallace is a high-performance, easy-to-use evolutionary computation framework written in Julia,
built for researchers, students, and software engineers alike.
 

To simultaneously achieve performance and ease-of-use, Wallace utilises computational reflection to
compile problem-specific data structures and algorithms at run-time, using a beautiful and compact
domain-specific language.
