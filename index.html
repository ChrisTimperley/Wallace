<p>
  Wallace is a high-performance, easy-to-use evolutionary computation framework written in
  <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a> built for researchers, students, and software engineers alike.
</p>

<p>
  To simultaneously achieve performance and ease-of-use, Wallace utilises computational reflection to
  compile problem-specific data structures and algorithms at run-time, using a beautiful and compact
  domain-specific language.
</p>

<p>
The result is a framework that is <b>more concise than the smallest existing alternatives</b>, such as DEAP,
and <b>at least as fast, if not faster than the leading alternative solutions</b>, such as ECJ and JCLEC.
