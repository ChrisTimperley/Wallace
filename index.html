<p>Wallace is a high-performance, easy-to-use evolutionary computation framework written in Julia,
built for researchers, students, and software engineers alike.</p>

<p>To simultaneously achieve performance and ease-of-use, Wallace utilises computational reflection to
compile problem-specific data structures and algorithms at run-time, using a beautiful and compact
domain-specific language.</p>

### Features

* A compact extensible domain-specific language.
* Multi-processing and multi-threading.
